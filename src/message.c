/*
 * Hook for logging messages to the output file
 *
 * This can be redirected with any method g_print()
 * can be re-directed.
 *
 * t_print
 *           is a g_print() but it puts a time stamp in front.
 * t_perror
 *           is a perror() replacement, it puts a time stamp in font
 *           and reports via g_print
 *
 * Note ALL messages of the program should go through these two functions
 * so it is easy to either silence them completely, or routing them to
 * a separate window for debugging purposes.
