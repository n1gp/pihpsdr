/*
 * Layer-3 of MIDI support
 *
 * In most cases, a certain action only makes sense for a specific
 * type. For example, changing the VFO frequency will only be implemeted
 * for MIDI_WHEEL, and TUNE off/on only with MIDI_KNOB.
 *
 * However, changing the volume makes sense both with MIDI_KNOB and MIDI_WHEEL.
